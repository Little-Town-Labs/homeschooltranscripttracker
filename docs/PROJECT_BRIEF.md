# Homeschool Transcript Tracker - Project Brief

## Project Overview

**Project Name:** Homeschool Transcript Tracker  
**Target Audience:** Homeschool parents/guardians in the United States  
**Purpose:** Digital platform to track and manage high school transcripts (grades 9-12) and standardized test scores for homeschooled students

## Problem Statement

Homeschool parents currently lack a comprehensive, user-friendly digital solution to:
- Track academic progress across 4 years of high school (grades 9-12)
- Maintain standardized test score records
- Generate professional transcripts for college applications and external communications
- Ensure transcript formatting meets institutional requirements

## Project Goals

### Primary Objectives
1. **Academic Tracking**: Enable parents to input and track coursework, grades, and credits for grades 9-12
2. **Test Score Management**: Record and organize standardized test scores (SAT, ACT, AP, CLEP, etc.)
3. **Professional Documentation**: Generate formatted transcripts with parent/guardian contact information
4. **Multi-Student Support**: Handle families with multiple homeschooled children
5. **External Communication**: Provide printable/exportable transcripts for colleges and institutions

### Success Metrics
- User-friendly interface requiring minimal technical knowledge
- Professional transcript output meeting standard formatting requirements
- Reliable data storage and retrieval
- Mobile-responsive design for accessibility

   - Account information, contact details, family information

2. **Students** 
   - Personal information, graduation year, current grade

3. **Courses**
   - Subject, level, credit hours, description, academic year

4. **Grades**
   - Course grades, semester/year, GPA calculations

5. **Test Scores**
   - Test type, date, scores, student association

6. **Transcripts**
   - Generated documents, formatting preferences, export history

## User Journey

### Initial Setup
1. Parent creates account with contact information
2. Adds student profiles with basic information
3. Sets up "school" information for transcript header

### Daily/Ongoing Use
1. Records completed courses and grades
2. Enters standardized test scores as received
3. Reviews academic progress and GPA tracking

### Transcript Generation
1. Selects student and academic period
2. Reviews and verifies information accuracy
3. Generates and downloads professional transcript
4. Shares with colleges or institutions as needed

## Technical Requirements

### Performance
- Fast page load times (<3 seconds)
- Responsive design for mobile devices
- Reliable data backup and recovery

### Security
- Encrypted data storage
- Secure user authentication
- FERPA-compliant data handling
- Regular security audits

### Scalability
- Support for growing user base
- Efficient database queries
- Optimized file storage and retrieval

## Project Constraints

### Technical Constraints
- Must deploy to Netlify
- Must use NeonDB as backend database
- Web-based application (no mobile app initially)

### Business Constraints
- Initial focus on US homeschool market
- Grades 9-12 only (no elementary/middle school)
- Self-hosted solution (not SaaS initially)

## Success Criteria

### MVP Requirements
1. User registration and authentication
2. Student profile management
3. Course and grade entry
4. Basic transcript generation
5. Test score recording

### Future Enhancements
1. Advanced reporting and analytics
2. Integration with online curriculum providers
3. Mobile application
4. Collaborative features for families
5. Compliance reporting for state requirements
